# **bamazon**
a command line (mock) product marketplace

This CLI uses node and the inquirer and mysql packages to ask the user which items (from a displayed list of items from a MySQL database currently containing dummy data) they would like to purchase, and their prices. If the desired quantity is available, the purchase will complete. If not, a message to the user explaining the shortage displays before showing the full item display again (to effectively restart the app).
